Directives are instructions for the preprocessor (the code gets edited before it gets compiled). For example the ``#include <stdio.h>`` or the ``#define``. Directives are one line long and don't end with a semicolon.

In versions prior to C99, declarations come before statements. We can't alternate between declaration, statement, declaration, statement...

When declaring a floating variable: ``float a = 3.14f;``

### Placeholders for printf

- **%d:** int variables
- **%f** float variables (this displays 6 decimals, to force p decimals: %.pf)
