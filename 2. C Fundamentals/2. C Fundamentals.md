Directives are instructions for the preprocessor (the code gets edited before it gets compiled). For example the ``#include <stdio.h>`` or the ``#define``. Directives are one line long and don't end with a semicolon.

In versions prior to C99, declarations come before statements. We can't alternate between declaration, statement, declaration, statement...

When declaring a floating variable: ``float a = 3.14f;``

### Placeholders for printf

- **%d:** int variables
- **%f** float variables (this displays 6 decimals, to force p decimals: %.pf)

Printf can also print expressions

```c
printf("%d\n", a * b * c) 
```

This will print the product of a, b and c and a line break.

### Scanf

Scanf is used to get input from the user. It uses a similar format to printf. ``scanf("%d", &x)`` This for example will scan an integer to the variable x.

### Identifiers

Identifiers in C must only contain letters, digits and underscores but they must begin with a ltter or underscore. C is case-sensitive.
