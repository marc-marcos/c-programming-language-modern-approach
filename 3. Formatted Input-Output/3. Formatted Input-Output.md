### More printf conversions

- **e**: Prints a float in exponential format. p indicates how many digits should appear after the decimal point.
- **g**: Prints a float in exponential format or fixed-point depending on the size of the number. 

### Escape sequences

- \\n new line
- \\a alert
- \\t next tab stop
- \\b backspace

To print a single % in a printf statement you need to print two \%\% so the command knows it shouldn't be a conversion.

### Scanf in depth

We can ask scanf to receive more than one input in the same call.

```c
int a, b;
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
```

This will take any two numbers separated by whitespaces (any number of whitespaces) and put them into a and b.

```c
int a, b;
scanf("%d/%d", &a, &b);)
```

This will take any two numbers separated by a slash and store the minto a and b.

#### Additional scanf conversion

**%i**: This also receives integer numbers but can also receive numbers in octal base (starting with a 0) and hexadecimal numbers (starting with 0x).
